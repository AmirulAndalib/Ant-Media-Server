## Introduction

Ant Media Server is a streaming engine software that provides adaptive, ultra-low latency streaming (less than 0.5 seconds with WebRTC and low latency using HLS or CMAF). 

Ant Media Server enables businesses to build high-performing infrastructure for video streaming, which is simple and easy to deploy. It is robust and highly scalable horizontally and vertically, running on-premises or on any cloud provider you choose.

## ⚡ Ant Media Server Features

Ant Media Server has two editions with unique features for high-quality live and on-demand video streaming, i.e. Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.

#### ⭐️ Community Edition

The Community Edition is a free, open-source version of Ant Media Server. It provides basic live streaming functionality with adaptive bitrate, transcoding, and support for WebRTC, RTMP, RTSP ingest, MP4, and HLS playback support. It also offers recording and playback of live streams, simulcasting, and RESTful APIs for server management.

#### ✨ Enterprise Edition

Ant Media Server's Enterprise Edition has advanced streaming capabilities and enhanced security features for better scalability. Here are some of the key features:

- **Sub-second Latency with WebRTC:** Ultra-low latency streaming using WebRTC technology with ~0.5 seconds latency.
- **Cluster Mode:** Deploy multiple instances of Ant Media Server in a cluster to handle large-scale streaming traffic and provide high availability and failover support.
- **WebRTC Data Channel:** Enable data transfer between clients in real-time using the WebRTC Data Channel.
- **WebRTC Server-Side Recording:** Record WebRTC streams on the server side without the need for browser-based recording.
- **Advanced Security:** Secure your streams with SSL/TLS encryption, token authentication, IP filtering, and watermarking.
- **Rich SDKs:** iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity and Javascript SDKs.
- **Professional Support:** Get access to dedicated technical support, training, and consulting services from the Ant Media team.

Choose Enterprise Edition for reliable, secure, and advanced video streaming with top-notch technical support. Visit our [website](https://antmedia.io) or send us an [email](mailto:contact@antmedia.io) for Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition. We're always happy to help!
